## ✅ Core Game Mechanics Implemented

### 1. Game Structure
- **Genre**: Turn-based strategy with territory control
- **Map**: Hexagonal grid (higher complexity as recommended)
- **Players**: 2 players (human or AI configurable)
- **Victory**: Control 60% of territory

### 2. Units System
Implemented 3 distinct unit types with full attributes:

| Unit | Cost (W/G/F) | PM | PA | PD | Health | Range | Preferred | Penalized |
|------|--------------|----|----|----|----|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Infantry | 30/20/10 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 20 | 1 | Plains | Mountain |
| Cavalry | 40/30/20 | 5 | 6 | 3 | 15 | 1 | Plains | Forest |
| Artillery | 60/50/30 | 2 | 8 | 2 | 12 | 3 | Plains | Mountain |

**Features:**
- ✅ Movement points (PM)
- ✅ Attack points (PA)
- ✅ Defense points (PD)
- ✅ Attack range
- ✅ Terrain preferences/penalties
- ✅ Health system
- ✅ Production costs

### 3. Map and Terrain
**Hexagonal Grid System:**
- ✅ Axial coordinate system (q, r)

## ✅ AI Architecture (3-Level Hierarchy)

### Level 1: Strategic AI (`Assets/Scripts/AI/Strategic/`)

**Purpose**: Global decision-making and long-term planning

**Components:**

   - ✅ Tracks friendly/enemy unit strength across map
   - ✅ Influence propagation with distance decay
   - ✅ Calculates security levels per cell
   - ✅ Identifies safe and vulnerable positions
   - ✅ Includes production building influence

2. **TacticalWaypoint.cs**
   - ✅ Defines strategic positions: Attack, Defense, Resource, Rally
   - ✅ Priority system for waypoint importance
   - ✅ Dynamic waypoint activation

3. **StrategicAI.cs**
   - ✅ Coordinates all units toward global objectives
   - ✅ Creates and manages tactical waypoints
   - ✅ Makes production decisions (what units to build)
   - ✅ Assigns objectives to Tactical AI
   - ✅ Analyzes map control and resource needs
   - ✅ Adapts strategy based on unit composition

**Strategic Variables Implemented:**
- ✅ Security (friendly vs enemy influence)
- ✅ Production Capacity (structures owned)

- ✅ Unit Composition (army balance)

### Level 2: Tactical AI (`Assets/Scripts/AI/Tactical/`)

**Purpose**: Unit-level decision making

**Components:**

1. **BehaviorTree.cs**
   - ✅ Behavior Tree framework (not simple FSM!)
   - ✅ Composite nodes: Sequence, Selector
   - ✅ Decorator nodes: Inverter
   - ✅ Execution context system

2. **BehaviorActions.cs**
   - ✅ Condition nodes: Health check, Enemy detection, Objective check

   - ✅ Tactical decision logic

3. **TacticalAI.cs**
   - ✅ Receives objectives from Strategic AI
   - ✅ Executes behavior tree for each unit
   - ✅ Decision priority system:
     1. Retreat if low health + enemy nearby
     2. Attack if enemy in range
     3. Move toward objective
     4. Defend position
   - ✅ Maximizes short-term benefit while advancing strategic goals

### Level 3: Operational AI (`Assets/Scripts/AI/Operational/`)

**Purpose**: Movement execution with pathfinding

**Components:**

1. **Pathfinding.cs**
   - ✅ **A* algorithm** for hexagonal grids
   - ✅ **Tactical pathfinding** with weighted costs:
     - Terrain movement cost
     - Unit terrain preferences
     - Enemy threat avoidance
     - Risk assessment
   - ✅ Reachable cell calculation
   - ✅ Path reconstruction
   - ✅ Obstacle avoidance

**Tactical Pathfinding Features:**
- Base movement cost from terrain
- Unit terrain preference modifiers
- Enemy proximity threat calculation
- Combined cost evaluation for optimal paths

---

## ✅ AI Integration (`Assets/Scripts/AI/AIController.cs`)

**Hierarchical Flow:**
```
Strategic AI
    ↓ (provides objectives)
Tactical AI
    ↓ (requests paths)
Operational AI
    ↓ (returns paths)
Tactical AI
    ↓ (executes movement)
Unit Actions
```

**Turn Execution:**
1. Strategic AI analyzes global situation
2. Strategic AI updates influence maps
3. Strategic AI creates/updates waypoints
4. Strategic AI makes production decisions
5. For each unit:
   - Strategic AI assigns objective
   - Tactical AI evaluates unit state
   - Tactical AI runs behavior tree
   - Operational AI computes paths
   - Unit executes action
